## Assignment 5 Practice Problems: The Box Model

### Question 4

Given the code below, what is the minimum width and height (in pixels) that the
`div` needs to entirely contain the `article` element (including its margins)?

```html
<div>
  <article>content</article>
</div>
```

```css
div {
  background-color: lightgray;
  border: 1px solid black;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

article {
  border: 4px solid red;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  display: inline-block;
  height: 300px;
  margin: 20px 19px 10px 11px;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  width: 500px;
}
```

### Solution

The `article` element's `box-sizing` is set to `border-box`. This means only
`margin` is added to the element's `width` and `height` to calculate its total
width and total height; `padding` and `border` are considered part of the
element's `width` and `height`. Therefore, the `article`'s total width is
`500px + 19px + 11px`, `530px`, and its total height is `300px + 20px + 10px`,
`330px`.

The `div` element's `box-sizing` is also set to `border-box`. Since the `div`
has a `1px` `border`, `0` `padding`, and is in `border-box` `box-sizing` mode,
its `width` and `height` must be `2px` greater than the `article` element's total
width and height. This is `width` `532px` and `height` `332px`.
