## Assignment 5 Practice Problems: The Box Model

### Question 7

**Challenge**. Given our solution to the previous question, what will happen if
we put the `article` tags on separate lines?

```html
<section>
  <article>content</article>
  <article>more content</article>
</section>
```

Try to figure out the answer without peeking. Why do you think this is?

### Solution

Placing the `article` tags on separate lines in the source `html` won't change
anything. Whitespace and newlines don't affect the browser's interpretation and
rendering of the page.
