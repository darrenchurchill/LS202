## Assignment 5 Practice Problems: The Box Model

### Question 7

**Challenge**. Given our solution to the previous question, what will happen if
we put the `article` tags on separate lines?

```html
<section>
  <article>content</article>
  <article>more content</article>
</section>
```

Try to figure out the answer without peeking. Why do you think this is?

### Solution

~~Placing the `article` tags on separate lines in the source `html` won't change
anything. Whitespace and newlines don't affect the browser's interpretation and
rendering of the page.~~

When you put each `article` tag on separate lines in the source, as above, the
browser will collapse the newline and two spaces of indentation between the
`inline-block` elements into a single space. Because each `article` has exactly
50% width, the single space prevents them from fitting on one line, and the
second `article` flows onto a second line.
