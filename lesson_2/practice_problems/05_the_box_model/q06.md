## Assignment 5 Practice Problems: The Box Model

### Question 6

Will the following code display the two article boxes side by side? If not, why
not? How would you fix it so that it places the boxes side by side?

```html
<section>
  <article>content</article><article>more content</article>
</section>
```

```css
section {
  background-color: yellow;
  border: 1px solid red;
  box-sizing: content-box;
  display: inline-block;
  height: 400px;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 900px;
}

article {
  background-color: lime;
  border: 1px solid blue;
  height: 100%;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 10px;
  width: 50%;
}
```

### Solution

No, the `article` elements will not display side by side.

By default, `article`s are `block` elements, so they render on their own line.
To change this, we could add a `display: inline-block;` property to the
`article` rule. However, in this case, the `article`s are still too wide to
fit on the same line.

The default `box-sizing` is `content-box`, so each `article`'s total width is
50% of the parent `section` width, plus the `padding`, `border` and `margin`.
This is a total of `900px * 0.5 + 2 * 10px + 2 * 1px`, `472px`, which is more
than half the `section`'s available content width, `900px`, because it's in
`content-box` mode.

Changing the `article`s' `box-sizing` to `border-box` would account for their
padding and border in the `width` definition, so their total width would be
exactly 50% of the parent `section`'s `width`, and they would fit on one line.
