## Assignment 5 Practice Problems: The Box Model

### Question 2

Given the code below, what is the minimum width and height (in pixels) that the
`div` needs to entirely contain the `section` element (including its margins)?
How does this differ from the result of the previous problem?

```html
<div>
  <section>content</section>
</div>
```

```css
div {
  background-color: lightgray;
  border: 1px solid black;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

section {
  border: 4px solid red;
  box-sizing: content-box;
  display: block;
  height: 300px;
  margin: 20px 19px 10px 11px;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  width: 500px;
}
```

### Solution

The `section` element's `box-sizing` is set to `content-box`. This means
`padding`, `border`, and `margin` are all added to the `width` and `height` to
get its total width and total height. Therefore, the `section` element's total
width is `500px + 2 * 20px + 2 * 4px + 19px + 11px`, `578px`, and its total
height is `300px + 2 * 10px + 2 * 4px + 20px + 10px`, `358px`. This is the same
as the `img` element in the previous problem, except the `section` element has
`block` `display` rather than the `img`'s `inline-block` `display`.

The `div` element's `box-sizing` is set to `border-box`. This means only
`margin` is added to the `width` and `height` to get its total width and total
height; `padding` and `border` are considered part of the element `width`.

Since the `div` has a `1px` `border`, `0` `padding`, and is in `border-box`
`box-sizing` mode, its `width` and `height` must be `2px` greater than the
`section` element's total width and height. This is `width` `580px` and `height`
`360px`.

This problem is mostly identical to the previous problem. The primary difference
is the `img` and `section` elements' `display` properties. The `section`
element, in `block` `display`, will always be on its own line, whereas the `img`
element, in `inline-block` `display`, might have other content next to it, if
there is any and there's remaining width on the line.
