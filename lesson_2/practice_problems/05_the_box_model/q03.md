## Assignment 5 Practice Problems: The Box Model

### Question 3

Given the code below, what is the minimum width and height (in pixels) that the
`div` needs to entirely contain the `em` element (including its margins)?

```html
<div>
  <em>content</em>
</div>
```

```css
div {
  background-color: lightgray;
  border: 1px solid black;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

em {
  border: 4px solid red;
  box-sizing: content-box;
  display: inline;
  height: 300px;
  margin: 20px 19px 10px 11px;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  width: 500px;
}
```

### Solution

The `em` element's `box-sizing` is set to `content-box`, but its `display` is
set to `inline`. Because it has `inline` `display`, the `width` and `height`
properties are ignored, and the element's width and height are instead
calculated from the element content. Top and bottom `margin` also get ignored.

The `em`'s total width is the width of the string `"content"` plus its
`padding`, `border` and `margin`, `"content" + 2 * 20px + 2 * 4px + 19px + 11px`,
`"content" + 78px`. The `em`'s total height is the height of the string
`"content"` plus its `padding` and `border`, `"content" + 2 * 10px + 2 * 4px`,
`"content" + 28px`.

The `div` element's `box-sizing` is set to `border-box`. This means only
`margin` is added to the `width` and `height` to get its total width and total
height; `padding` and `border` are considered part of the element `width`.

Since the `div` has a `1px` `border`, `0` `padding`, and is in `border-box`
`box-sizing` mode, its `width` and `height` must be `2px` greater than the `em`
element's total width and height. This is `width` `"content" + 80px` and
`height` `"content" + 30px`.
