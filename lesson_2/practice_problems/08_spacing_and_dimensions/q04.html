Spacing and Dimensions
Question 4

As you can see, having a variable size for one dimension and fixed for the other
makes for a container with strange behavior: this one stretches horizontally but
remains fixed vertically. Remove the height and update the CSS to ensure the
width does not get smaller than 500 pixels.
