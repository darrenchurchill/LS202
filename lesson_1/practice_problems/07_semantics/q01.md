## Assignment 7 Practice Problems: Semantics

### Question 1

Which of these tags are semantic, and which are not?

- `<article>`
- `<footer>`
- `<span>`
- `<aside>`
- `<h3>`
- `<strong>`
- `<b>`
- `<header>`
- `<div>`
- `<section>`

### Solution

All tags in HTML5 except `div` and `span` have semantic meaning. This includes
`b` and `i`, whose meanings may have subtly changed from HTML4.

- `<article>`
  This element could represent a news article, blog post, article comment, or
  many other types of content.
- `<footer>`
  This element represents a page footer content.
- `<aside>`
  This element might not be strictly required to understand the page's main
  content, but it still related to the page. For example, a pullquote, sidebar,
  comments section, or advertising could go into an aside.
- `<h3>`
  This element represents a page heading.
- `<strong>`
  This element represents an element with "strong importance".
- `<b>`
  This element is the "bring attention to" element, "used to draw the reader's
  attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special
  importance." -  from [MDN][MDN_b_element]
- `<header>`
  This element represents a page header content, it might contain some banner
  text or the navigation menu.
- `<section>`
  This element represents a logical section of the page content, or possibly
  a chapter of a longer piece of writing.
