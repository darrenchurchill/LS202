# JS202 Lesson 1

## Assignment 7 Practice Problems: Semantics

### Question 5

Given the following HTML, would  `<aside>`, `<section>`, `<blockquote>`, or
`<div>` be the most appropriate element for the tag shown as `<sometag>`?

```html
<h3>Hex Colors</h3>

<p>
  Most graphics and design applications like Photoshop and Pixelmator display
  colors in hexadecimal format, so it's easy to copy and paste color values you
  need from one program into your editor as a CSS property.
</p>

<sometag>
  <p>
    If you're unfamiliar with the hexadecimal numbering system, it uses 16
    different digits instead of the ten the decimal system uses. The hex digits
    are "0" through "9", as in the decimal system, but also include "a" through
    "f" (or "A" through "F") as valid digits.
  </p>
</sometag>
```

### Solution

The content would probably be most appropriate in an `<aside>`; you might
consider the description of hex numbers tangential to hex colors. It could also
fit in a `<section>` with an extra heading tag, like `<h4>Hex numbering</h4>`.
And if you just wanted to style the block differently, a non-semantic `<div>`
would be appropriate.
