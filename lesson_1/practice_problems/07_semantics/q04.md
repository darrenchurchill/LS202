## Assignment 7 Practice Problems: Semantics

### Question 4

Given the following HTML, would `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<article>`, or `<div>`
be the most appropriate element for the tag shown as `<sometag>`?

```html
<sometag>
  <h3>Text-align Property</h3>
  <p>
    Given the width of the paragraph, the heading looks odd hanging out on the
    left side of the screen. Let's center it instead; we'll do this with the
    text-align property;
  </p>

  <pre>
    <h1 style="color: orange; text-align: center;">Hello, Internet!</h1>
  </pre>
</sometag>
```

### Solution

`<section>` could be appropriate if this content was part of a larger page with
other content on it. `<aside>` could be appropriate if the page's main content
was about a different topic, and this content just mentioned the `text-align`
property before moving on with the main topic. The content above seems to
reference some previous content not shown, so probably doesn't stand on it's own
like an `<article>` should.
